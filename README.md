# Detect_Fraudulent_Activities
#### This is a challenge made by MLAcadmy, which aims to detect and recognize clients involved in fraudulent activities. The solution will enhance the companyâ€™s revenues and reduce the losses caused by such fraudulent activities.

## There are four files:
- Client_train.csv: Client information in the train population.
- Invoice_train.csv: Clients invoice in the train set.
- Client_test.csv: Client information for the test population.
- Invoice_test.csv: Clients invoice in the test set.
